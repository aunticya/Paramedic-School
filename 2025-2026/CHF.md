**Pathology**
Results in the heart not pumping blood effectively. This occurs because of increased peripheral or systemic vascular resistance (increased pressure).
This causes hydrostatic pressure to build up in the lung capillaries, overcoming the oncotic pressure within those capillaries. As a result, fluid flows out, resulting in pulmonary edema. 

Left Sided Heart failure doesn't result in peripheral edema. Only right sided does. Right doesn't lead to left, but left sided failure can lead to right sided.

**Associated Issues**
As the fluid moves into alveolar space, inflammation occurs (alveoli don't want that fluid). Lung tissue inflammation results in [[wheezing]], a.k.a [[Cardiac Asthma]]. So [[wheezing]] precedes [[crackles]].

**Treatments:**
[[Nitroglycerin]] is a vasodilator, dilating coronary arteries, reducing pressure, alleviating CHF.

[[CPAP]] increases alveolar pressure, counteracting high hydrostatic pressure.
