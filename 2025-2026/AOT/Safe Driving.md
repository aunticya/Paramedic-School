	- We're governed by highway traffic act
	- HTA 144 Red Light
		- You may proceed without a green, but only when it is safe to do so. You **must** stop and observe. If accidents occur, it's always your fault.
		- Requires you have sirens and lights on
		- Stop signs can't be run through
	- HTA 128
		- Ambulances must have an emergency response vehicle number by the MOHLTC. Even ice cream truck vans can be one if they have a number
		- Speed limits can be surpassed reasonably
			- Maximum safe speed decided at discretion of operator
			- Only applies in emergency situations, both to and from site
			- Ideally no more than 20-40km (not a hard rule)
		- You're allowed to pass into oncoming traffic, but it's very dangerous

- **With emergency lights on, you must go in left lane** (to allow civilians to pull right)**. If you need to turn right, go into middle lane near the turn, then turn right after checking mirrors.**

- 1 in 20 drivers are involved in a collision annually
- On average 100 driving decisions per km
- 90% of collisions are preventable
- Defensive driving based on 3 ideas:
	- Visibility
	- Space
	- Communications


- 6 star approach to defensive driving
	- Circle check
		- Make sure you're physically and mentally prepared as well
		- plan route
		- use seat belt
			- 3 out of 4 ejected from a vehicle die
			- 8 out of 10 fatalities in rollovers are from ejection
			- Paramedics and all passengers **must** wear seatbelts at all times **unless** providing patient care 
	- Eye lead time
		- Minimum of 15-20 seconds ahead
			- in town = 1-1.5 blocks
			- in highway = 400m/4 football fields
	- moving eyes
		- every 2 seconds
		- check mirrors every 5-8 seconds
	- being proactive
		- SCC (use both emergencies and non emergencies)
			- Scanning all around the ambulance
		- Point of no return = if light turns yellow I'd have to keep going
		- Cover break horn if you spot hazard up ahead
		- reverse park if possible
	- being predictable
		- maintain 4-5 second distance in cities
		- don't use cruise control if there's adverse conditions (raining can result in hydroplaning)
	- using a space cushion
		- **Total Stopping Distance** = Perception Distance + Reaction distance + Breaking Distance + Break Lag Distance (only for air break ambulances)
			- Perception Distance = Distance between when you spot hazard and when you decide to take an action
			- Reaction Distance = Distance between you deciding to break, and actually pressing the break (avg 0.75 secs)
				- Hover break to reduce this by reducing movement time
			- Break Lag Distance (only airbrake ambulances)
				- Distance between applying breaks and them activating (approximate 0.5 secs)
			- Breaking Distance = Distance between pressing break and how long it takes to stop
		- Under 60kmph = 4 secs
		- Over 60kmph = 5 secs
